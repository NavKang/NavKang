#### Python Ramble
Practice as much python as you can. Build small basic programs and build on them. There are plenty of very good resources online to learn python. Some of the books I highly recommend are:

+ Python Crash Course

+ Head First Python

+ The Coder's Apprentice

*To become a good programmer, you must practice. This is the advice I live by, and to become a good programmer is my goal.*
